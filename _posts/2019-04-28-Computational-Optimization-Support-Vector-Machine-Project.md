title: Computational Optimization Support Vector Machine Project 
---

For this final project, we were tasked with creating a support vector machine (SVM) to classify random data, and see how said model compared to the instructor's model. 

Results were summarized [here](/static/pdf/projects/2019S-MATP-4610-final-project.pdf).
