title: "NLP Terms of Service Summarization"
---

For our Natural Language Processing (NLP) class, we were tasked with doing something innovative with what we learned from the class itself. 
My group decided to try and tackle the idea of summarizing Terms of Service (ToS) documents.

We formulated two approaches:

  1. An unsupervised LexRank model
  2. A supervised model that addressed the problem as a classification problem for each sentence.

My work focused primarily on the second model. In addition, I was in charge of scraping, cleaning, and generating data from a collection of ToS web-pages.
