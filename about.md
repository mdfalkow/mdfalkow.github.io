## About Me

<!-- <span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span> -->

My name is Mitchell Falkow, and I am a senior at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. I am pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics, with concentrations in Artificial Intelligence, Data Sciences, and Operatons Research.

I am a member of the [Rensselaer Center for Open Source](https://rcos.io), where I help develop and contribute to open source projects in addition to mentoring other students. I am also a volunteer instructor for [coding&&community](https://codingandcommunity.org/).

One of my biggest hobbies is studying karate. I have been practicing the Shorin-ryu Shidokan style of karate since 2008. I am currently a 3rd degree black belt. As a black belt, I have been leading classes for children, teens, and adults for many years now. I still lead classes while in college, but really only when I am home from college. 

In my free time I also enjoy playing video games. While series like *The Legend of Zelda*, *Pok√©mon*, and *Super Smash Bros* are some of my favorites, I also enjoy games such as *Borderlands 2*, *Sid Meier's Civilization*, and *Binding of Isaac*. These are just a few games and series which I really enjoy -- the list would be very long if I tried to include all of them.

Music is a big part of my life. I can't play any instruments (funny enough, I do own a guitar), but I do enjoy listening to music a lot. My favorite genre by far is classic rock, while my all-time favorite band is Queen -- closely followed by Yes, Talking Heads, Rush, and Genesis.

I hope that gives a little bit more insight into the type of person I am. If you have any questions or would like to reach out to me, feel free to send me an email at [mdfalkow@gmail.com](mailto:mdfalkow@gmail.com).
